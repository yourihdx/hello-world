I started using Ubuntu 15.10 about a month ago, and this week I have installed it as my primary OS.

This is another edit, just to check, I wrote this line at 2016-03-07 12:45.

Yet another line, to check if everything is working okay. 2016-03-07 15:17.

This line has been added from the Remarkable Markdown Editor to see the CF LF changes made.
